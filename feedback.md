# Feedback

## Project Workflow

**Meets Expectations** Excellent presentation!! In the future, please include setup
instructions in the readme, including `rake db:create`, `rake db:migrate`, etc.. This will
be useful for future technical reviewers (and you) who might not be familiar with setting
up rails applications.

## Technical Requirements

**Exceeds Expectations** So many cool technical implementations in this project!! I am
especially impressed with your import from CSV feature, as well as the 3d css used to flip
the card. You might want to think about adding an export to csv feature as well.

## Creativity / Interface

**Exceeds Expectations** Again, awesome flipping animation! I also really like that you
added keyboard functionality for navigating through the decks and flipping cards. Maybe you
could add a question mark or flash message to let the user know this is possible - even though
many will assume this feature is present.

## Code Quality
